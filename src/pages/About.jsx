        <h1>Hey there,</h1>
        <h3>I'm Yane.</h3>

        <p>
          A UI Developer chilling in Lisbon, where the sun is warm and the
          pastéis de nata are unbeatable. With a quirky blend of scientific
          research and customer support tucked under my belt, I bring a fresh
          perspective to the table.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ever since I can remember, I've been fueled by curiosity. It's what
          drove me from test tubes to lines of code, always seeking to
          understand and improve.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've got a knack for turning ideas into reality, whether I'm tweaking
          code or crafting pixel-perfect designs. It's like being a mad
          scientist in a digital lab, mixing creativity with logic to cook up
          something truly magical.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I'm not lost in the digital wilderness, you'll find me chasing
          sunsets with my camera, plotting world domination over a board game,
          or sipping espresso at the latest hipster café.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm here to make a difference, to shake things up, and to create
          experiences that leave a lasting impact. Let's make some magic happen!
